# PCF_BasicMeter
A basic PCF control using a React component to display a 1 - 10 integer using an LED style meter 

This was an effort for me (a non-javascript dev) to stretch my muscles and come up with a PCF control that does 
something -- regardless of how simplistic it is. :-)

The basic requirement to use this control is to have an entity that uses a Whole Number field with min=1 and max=10. Then
add this control to a form and bind it to the field. By clicking a block on the graphic you are changing the value in CDS 
for this record.

Click [here](/BasicMeterControl.gif) to see what it looks like. I see a lot of opportunity for improvement and customization, but that is for another day
